# üì∏ UnityImagePickerLib

**UnityImagePickerLib** is a Unity-native Android plugin that allows seamless image selection from the **gallery or camera**, with **built-in cropping support**, permission handling, and image import directly into Unity‚Äôs `RawImage` UI component.

## üîß Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Build the AAR Library

1. Open `ImagePicker_lib` folder in **Android Studio**.
2. Build the `.aar` file:

   * Go to **Build > Make Project** or run `./gradlew assembleRelease`.
3. Locate the generated AAR:

   ```
   ImagePicker_lib/build/outputs/aar/ImagePicker_lib-release.aar
   ```

---

### Step 2: Import AAR into Unity

1. Copy the `.aar` into your Unity project under:

   ```
   Assets/Plugins/Android/
   ```
2. In Unity Editor:

   * Select the `.aar` file
   * **Inspector Settings:**

     * ‚úÖ `Android`: checked
     * ‚ùå `Any Platform`: unchecked

---

### Step 3: Add Required Android Permissions

In your Unity AndroidManifest (`Assets/Plugins/Android/AndroidManifest.xml`), add:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES" />
```

> ‚úÖ The plugin also automatically opens the cropper activity and returns the **cropped image path** to Unity.

---

### Step 4: Unity C# Usage ‚Äì Integration Example

Here's how to trigger the image picker and load the result into a `RawImage` UI component:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class ImagePickerExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    private const string PluginClass = "com.myteam11.imagepicker_lib.ImagePicker";
    private const string GameObjectName = "ImagePickerReceiver"; // Must match the GameObject in scene

    public void PickImageFromGallery()
    {
        using (AndroidJavaClass imagePicker = new AndroidJavaClass(PluginClass))
        {
            imagePicker.CallStatic("pickImageFromGallery", GameObjectName, "OnImagePickedSuccess", "OnImagePickedFailure");
        }
    }

    public void PickImageFromCamera()
    {
        using (AndroidJavaClass imagePicker = new AndroidJavaClass(PluginClass))
        {
            imagePicker.CallStatic("pickImageFromCamera", GameObjectName, "OnImagePickedSuccess", "OnImagePickedFailure");
        }
    }
}
```

---

### Step 5: Handle Result in Unity

Your GameObject (e.g., `ImagePickerReceiver`) should implement the following callbacks:

```csharp
public void OnImagePickedSuccess(string path)
{
    // Load image from path and display in RawImage
    byte[] imageBytes = File.ReadAllBytes(path);
    Texture2D tex = new Texture2D(2, 2);
    tex.LoadImage(imageBytes);

    rawImage.texture = tex;
    rawImage.SetNativeSize();

    Debug.Log("Image loaded: " + path);
}

public void OnImagePickedFailure(string error)
{
    Debug.LogError("Image picking failed: " + error);
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Included FilePickerReceiver.cs (Advanced Example)

For a complete, production-ready setup with UI panels, permission handling, and file renaming, use the provided script `FilePickerReceiver.cs`. Key features include:

* Modular image picker setup
* Automatically updates:

  * ‚úÖ `RawImage`
  * ‚úÖ Image name and size (`TMP_Text`)
* Cropped image automatically handled (Android plugin)

To initialize the script from Unity UI:

```csharp
filePickerReceiver.Initialize(rawImage, beforeUploadPanel, afterUploadPanel, imageNameText, imageSizeText);
filePickerReceiver.ShowFilePicker();
```

---

## üß† How Cropping Works

The Android plugin uses a built-in **cropper** (e.g., `uCrop`) after image capture or selection. Once the image is cropped, its path is returned to Unity via:

```java
UnityPlayer.UnitySendMessage(gameObjectName, "OnImagePickedSuccess", croppedImagePath);
```

‚úÖ No need for additional cropping logic in Unity.
